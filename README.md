# NFC Surveys 🦔

## **What if PostHog surveys were _real_?**

Now with the physical survey, you can do your PostHog surveys IRL with our app and this physical survey builder.

You can create your survey with this React Native app and then write the responses to NFC tags that you'll place in the physical 3D printed survey. Tap to vote. It's that simple.

**Design systems? NAAAAH. 3D printed hogs 👍🏼👍🏼**

## How it works

### 1. Create your survey

Open the app and create a survey. Give it a name. Make it spicy.

### 2. Add your follow-up questions

For now users can only answer YES or NO. But you can add follow-up questions, or keep it as simple as that.

Follow-up questions can be:

- **Rating** - "How much do you love hedgehogs? 1-10"
- **Single answer** - "Tabs or spaces?" (there's only one right answer)
- **Multiple answer** - "What features do you want?" (let them pick all the things)
- 
### 3. Write to NFC tags

Tap your phone to NFC tags to write the response options. Each tag = one answer option (YES or NO).

### 4. Place them in your 3D printed survey

Stick those NFC tags in your beautiful 3D printed survey contraption. Put it somewhere people can tap.

### 5. Collect responses

People tap. You get data. No screens. No pop-ups. Just vibes.

## Tech Stack

- **React Native** (Expo) - The app
- **Convex** - The backend that actually works
- **NFC** - The magic beans

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies

## Why?

Because sometimes you want to touch grass AND collect user feedback at the same time.
